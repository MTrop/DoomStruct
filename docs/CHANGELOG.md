-----------------

- `Fixed` Tall patches/pictures were still mangled on export. (Issue #20)

-----------------

- `Fixed` Proper padding values on DMX sound export. (Issue #19)


Changed in 2.15.1
-----------------

- `Changed` NameUtils: Valid entry names and texture names are virtually the same.


Changed in 2.15.0
-----------------

Changed in 2.14.1
-----------------

- `Fixed` Force dot `.` as the decimal separator in the UDMF parser. It used to rely on the locale's separator
  by default. This is wildly incorrect.


Changed in 2.14.0
-----------------

- `Added` WadFile constructors can now specify read or write mode.
- `Changed` WadFiles are now opened in an appropriate mode due to file read/write capability by default.

-----------------

- `Fixed` WadFile.writeHeader() did not write the IWAD/PWAD magic number on change.


Changed in 2.11.0
-----------------

- `Fixed` Palette.getNearestColorIndex(), because apparently it never worked.


Changed in 2.10.1
-----------------

- `Fixed` WadBuffer.WadBufferInputStream may sometimes return 0xff (-1) itself, killing the stream prematurely. This has been fixed.
